      <div class="overview">
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>During my time completing CareerFoundry's UX Immersion course, my main project was Community Garbage. The idea of Community Garbage is to create a scavenger hunt game that gets people to go out into their community to clean up trash in
          parks, hiking trails, beaches, lakes, bus stops, neighborhoods, etc. Not only does it let people interact with others in a fun and productive way, but the app serves as a vehicle to get users inspired to do public service activities, and
          collectively make the environment around them a cleaner place.</p>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>People need a fun way of being involved in cleaning up their community. It can be difficult to have the motivation to clean up your neighborhoods, especially when it can be a laborious and monotonous task. Making a game out of cleaning up
          the communities around us will make a very difficult task into a fun, easy, social, and rewarding activity for users.</p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Enable users to get out and make a difference in their city by cleaning up the neighborhoods they love and meet new people in their community.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div id="competitive analysis">
        <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <p>To start my research, I performed a competitive analysis on two popular apps. My goal was to look at other scavenger hunt and GPS based games and observe their behaviors, strengths, weaknesses, and overall design. In my analysis I
          conducted competitor profiles, market research, and SWOT analyses.</p>
        <h2>SWOT Analysis Goose Chase App</h2>
        <p>GooseChase is a scavenger hunt app where you can pick from pre-made missions or create your own, play with your friends, and compete for the highest score.</p>

        <p>Pokemon Go is a highly popular mobile game that uses a GPS tracker of the user, so they can go out into their community and catch virtual monsters.</p>

      <div id="user insights">
        <h1>User Insights</h1>
        <p>After gathering data on other scavenger hunt apps, I reached out to potential users next to gather insight on who would use the kind of app I was designing. An unmonitored survey and one on one interviews were conducted to gather user
          insight for my app.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Eco-conscious users: Understand the methods and reasoning behind current eco-conscious habits, what they feel they can do in their community about it, and why it’s important to them. </li>
          <li>Community Engagement: Get a feeling on what community engagement means to them, if they’ve participated in community work before/why or why not/what would motivate them to participate, their thoughts on feelings on community projects
            and cleanups within their community.</li>
          <li>Games: Understand their thoughts and experience with games (“what is a game to you?”), how they feel games can be important to being motivated and productive people, and how they interact with games and apps in their daily lives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>User Interviews and Survey Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Being able to challenge or play with your friends makes games more fun to play.</li>
          <li>Having a feature where games are public and people can sign up to play is important for those who want to be more involved with their community.</li>
          <li>Pre-made missions are great to have so that people can go on their own adventure with friends without having to go through to make their own.</li>
          <li>Using public points of interest will get users out into community, where maybe they would not have gone before.</li>
          <li>Games are more fun when there’s competition between teams, so adding a ranking system or leaderboard is essential.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="user personas">
        <h1>User Personas</h1>
        <p>Based on user insights, I created three user personas who are potential users for Community Garbage. From the data I collected previously, I was able to create these personas, each with their own goals, needs, behaviors, and personality.
          My intention in creating these personas is to create empathy and connection with my potential users, and understand what each target audience would expect in an app like Community Garbage.</p>

        <h1>User Flows</h1>
        <p>Based on the persona's need and motivations, I designed user flows to better understand the steps necessary to complete an important task. The task flows slightly changed over time with new iterations of the app after user testing.</p>

        <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
        <h2>Card Sort Exercise</h2>
        <p>After completing my user flows, I created my first site map to get an idea of how the entire app would pan out. Subsequently, I conducted a closed card sort using OptimalSort to see if my site map plan was consistent with what users had in
          mind as well. The card sort exercise helped reaffirm my ideas for the sitemap of this app. It was helpful to analyze and understand what other users expect out of a scavenger hunt game of this nature.

          For example, “Recommendations for Trash and Recycling Drop Offs” was sorted on the “Home” screen by half of the participants. I originally had the idea to put the recommendations after a game is played, but I decided to add this into the
          main navigation bar in case a person wanted to see trash and recycling centers near them before they search for a game. </p>
        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <p>I created my site map based on my user flows and competitive analysis results. I wanted to make sure the game flow was intuitive, and all the information the user could want was easily accessible. Below are my two iterations of my site
          map. Based on the results of the card sort, in the second site map I’ve added a “Recommendations for Drop Offs” for the home navigation bar, and “Search for User” in your profile page.</p>

        <p>Pen and paper is a quick way to jot down first ideas and the bare bones of the app's layout. I started to sketch out some main features of the app, like Sign Up, Create Game, and Find Game.</p>
        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes - Adobe XD</h2>
        <p>For the remainder of the project, I used Adobe XD to build out my wireframes and put together a full prototype. Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helped me have a better concept of how I wanted to put the app together, and start considering
          what sorts of icons, colors, font, and design patterns I will integrate in the final versions.</p>

        <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
        <p>After completing the task flows of my major features, and creating onboarding for the app, it was time to put what I had worked on so far to the test.</p>
        <p>Goals
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the core features of the app are usable, functional, and intuitive.</li>
            <li>Game flow is consistent and makes sense to new users.</li>
            <li>To address any roadblocks or inconsistencies in the prototypes.</li>
          </ul>
          I recruited 6 participants for in-person interviews and testing of the current prototype. I prepared a usability testing script, and recorded the audio and screen with hot spots of each test.
        </p>
        <p>Test Objectives
          <ul>
            <li>Sign up process is sufficient for what the user would need to get into the app</li>
            <li>The purpose of the Navigation Hub makes sense.</li>
            <li>Do users like the idea of being able to access the Navigation Hub? Or would they prefer a navigation bar on each screen?</li>
            <li>Is the full process of creating a game making sense to users?</li>
            <li>Are there other features that seem missing that would be vital to creating a game?</li>
            <li>Finding a game to join is suitable for users who are searching.</li>
            <li>In-game navigation and game play has appropriate flow and information for what users would require.</li>
          </ul>
          After testing, I compiled all of my information into a rainbow usability spreadsheet and did some affinity mapping to understand the data I collected.</p>

        <h2>Usability Test Report - Major Changes</h2>
        <p>Issue 1: Invite Friend page did not allow more than one person to be invited at a time.
          <br>
          Evidence: What it was doing is allowing you to click into the username box to invite a friend, the username would populate, and you can send the invitation. The username would remain in the box, and the prototype would not let you delete
          the name to add a person. This also adds a step in having to go back and add another person and then press the button again. My new idea will let users invite more than one person at a time, and only press the invite button once.
          <br>
          Solution: Creating a one-click flow to invite friends to a game.</p>
        <p>Issue 2: Some users were confused or hesitated at the first page of Game Play. They were unsure what to do with the missions or exactly how the game play worked.
          <br>
          Evidence: Smartphone markers showed hesitance and clicking around on page because of uncertainty, and users expressed confusion in interview.
          <br>
          Solution: Create an onboarding sequence before entering the game.</p>
        <p> Issue 3: After selecting a mission to complete and snapping evidence, next page of Uploads is not clear. Flow is intended to be Snap Evidence > take picture with phone camera > upload it to be evaluated > be able to view what picture you
          took.
          <br>
          Evidence: After the user snapped their evidence of the mission completion, every user was confused at the Upload screen and I had to explain to them my intention.
          <br>
          Solution: Create a mock phone camera to simulate how users would use their phone camera to snap a picture of their evidence.
        </p>
        <h2>Preference Test</h2>
        <p>After usability testing, I conducted a preference test with the first screen of the app, which includes the title, some info about what the app is, and a button to begin.
          The first, purple screen was my original first screen of the app, and the rest of the onboarding screens followed the same design. However, participants of the preference test much preferred the new screen, which is more simple and readable
          than the original purple screen. Generally, people said the new screen was easier to read, more clean and simple, and liked the colors better. Those who picked the original screen did say that they thought it was more fun, whimsical/joyful,
          and is more creative. Because of the clear popularity in the first and new onboarding screen, I updated the remainder of my onboarding, and updated the colors and buttons for the entire app.</p>

          and creating beautiful, visually appealing designs.</p>
        <h2>Design Systems</h2>
        <h2>Final Testing and Complete Prototype</h2>
        <p>Last rounds of testing were a bit more informal, with fellow CareerFoundry UX students and peers of mine. Final adjustments involved fleshing out more user flows and actions, reducing redundancy, reworking a few features, and making sure
          all design screens were up to accessibility standards.</p>
        <p>Main features of the app:
          <ul>

        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>Designing Community Garbage was a challenging and rewarding experience. Going through the end-to-end design process helped me understand the importance of doing my due diligence in research, testing, and interacting with users. The data I
          gathered and users I spoke with aided me in creating a beautiful, usable, and functional high fidelity prototype. Community Garbage has gone through several design iterations with usability testing, preference testing, mentor feedback, and
          fellow UX designer feedback. That being said, there is still more room to improve and I am just getting my product off the ground.
          <br>
          What’s Next
          <br>
          I’d like to continue to test my prototype with users to see if there are any other areas that can be improved upon in the current features. I’d also like to start building upon the Profile section and Trash and Recycling Drop Off sections
          of the app, to complete the functionality. This case study showed me the importance of research methods and continual testing throughout the project, and I aim to use these skills in future projects moving forward. With this in mind, the
          scavenger hunt experience of Community Garbage will continue to improve as I dig deeper into further research, testing, new iterations, and new features of the app. </p>
